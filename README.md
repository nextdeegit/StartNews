StartNews: Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project 7

Start News is a news app that reads news from a local news site using rss feeds and renders them in a user friendly way in a list view. When a user clicks, it will load in webView in a detailed activity.

When you launch it the first time, it will fetch latest news from the Internet and store them locally in the phone. When you relaunch the app, it will present the locally stored version for the user while checking in the background for any update. If it finds something new, it will update the local storage.
